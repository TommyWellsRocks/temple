# Temple Site
Live: https://www.trytemple.com

Your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Things of Note:
- The tests likely won't work. Works with my custom test account and database connection.
- Overview Setup: Postgres database, next.js app router, with zustand state management.
- I'm rebuilding with a 2 page workout setup. So contributions might not be useful yet. (Will remove this when done).

## Grateful Contributions:
- Any improvements/rewrites you can see worth while
- A demo mode/version of the site (google account not required or some fake account)
- Non-flakey and thorough tests
